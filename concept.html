      <h4> What is freight management?</h4>
      <p> Freight management is the process of efficiently and strategically moving freight across a network from its
        point of origin to its desired destination using various modes of transportation, intermediaries, and
        technologies.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>
        Why has freight management become such an important component of business?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The ability to deliver freight on time to the right destination, in the right quantity, damage-free, and at the
        lowest possible cost, has always been critically important to businesses. In today’s competitive environment,
        this ability is more important than ever due to factors such as leaner shipper inventories, just-in-time
        manufacturing, rising warehousing and labor costs, tighter delivery windows, and consumer fulfillment
        expectations driven by ecommerce.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>
        What modes of transportation do freight managers use?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Freight mangers ship cargo by air, rail, road, and water. Combinations of these modes, often referred to as
        intermodal transportation, are also used to provide optimal logistics and delivery solutions. Within the United
        States, roughly 70% of freight is transported by commercial trucks.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>
        How can a shipper maintain high levels of visibility and transparency?
      </h4>
      <p>Technology is a critical piece of the visibility and transparency puzzle. 3PLs and LLPs use tools such as
        transportation management systems to track and trace the movement of freight and disseminate this information to
        authorized parties as quickly as possible.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>
        What is a transportation management system (TMS)?
      </h4>
      <p>A transportation management system (TMS) is a platform for managing freight and freight flows. One of the most
        important tools in the logistics toolbox, TMS technology has evolved rapidly over the last decade. Modern
        systems support day-to-day freight operations as well as strategic decision-making through advanced analytics.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>
        How is Internet of Things technology applied in freight management?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Internet of Things (IoT) is the term used to describe technology that connects everyday objects to the internet
        via sensing devices. Products and components moving through supply chains as well as assets such as trucks can
        be tracked using IoT-based sensing systems. These systems provide companies with real-time or near real-time
        location data and status updates such as the temperature of loads.

      <h4>What is a routing guide?
      </h4>
      <p>
        A routing guide is a guide to which carrier or carriers a company chooses to move its freight. Routing guides
        come in many forms, but generally include preferred carriers that align with the shipper’s logistics needs.
